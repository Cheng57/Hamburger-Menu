# Hamburger-Menu
Hamburger Menu with CSS Transform, Transition, and Animation
This project demonstrates a responsive hamburger menu using pure CSS for animations and transitions. The menu button, styled as a traditional "hamburger" icon, transforms into a cross when clicked. The transformation includes:

- Menu Button Animation: The hamburger icon rotates and transitions smoothly into a cross upon clicking.
- Dropdown Menu: The navigation menu slides down and becomes visible.
- Reverse Animation: When the cross icon is clicked, the dropdown menu disappears, and the button transitions back into the original hamburger icon.
  
The effect is achieved using CSS properties like transform, transition, and animation, with no JavaScript required.
